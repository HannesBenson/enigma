### How to run
To encode a message, simple go to your command line and run `./encode`. If you would like to use a file, pass it as a comman line argument. If you do not pass an argument you will be asked to enter the message. When passing in a file name the full path or relative path needs to be specified.

### Some assumptions
* You have ruby installed
